I am currently a doctoral candidate at the Georgia Institute of Technologyâ€™s Literature, Media and Communication department. My research interests straddles the fields of Science, Technology and Society, infrastructure studies and media/data studies.

My recent work has focused on infrastructures with a focus on environmental sensing and cyberinfrastructures. I mainly employ ethnographic and critical making techniques as ways to understand such infrastructures. Some projects I have worked on include a study of the development of a novel sea-level monitoring infrastructure, an ethnography of citizen weather observers and local collaborative mapping techniques. Throughout my research, I explore the intersection of infrastructures, environmental humanities, geography(political and urban) and digital technologies.

I also do have a technical background as I have an undergraduate degree in information technology from Strathmore University. I also hold a Master of Science degree in Media Arts and Sciences from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
