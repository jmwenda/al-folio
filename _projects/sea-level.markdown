The Smart Sea Level Sensors project  brings together different institutions including Chatham Emergency Management, City of Savannah, academics from Georgia Tech and other universities in building a network of sea-level sensors. Real time data from these novel sensors are used for flood modeling and addressing long term climate resiliency issues. I initially joined the project as a GIS developer but later on took on the position of an ethnographer studying this project for my dissertation. More information on the project can be found <a href="https://www.sealevelsensors.org/">here.</a>
