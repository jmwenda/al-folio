This is a project that my graduate advisor has been working on since 2019. I was partially responsible for the maintenance and software development of the digital artifact. Also, I co-facilitated several map making workshops working with local participants to prepare datasets and the apparatus for use. The Map Room Project aims to empower people to understand, but also challenge and even redefine the stories that maps and data tell about their lives, and about the places they live.
