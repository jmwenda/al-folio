This is a study that I picked up in the early days before my dissertation proposal stage. In this project I utilized mixed methods to understand how weather observers contribute to the production of climate knowledge. The first part of this study was a mixed method utilizing an auto-ethnographic perspective of living with a weather station at home. Critical making was also part of the methods here as I utilized a small Raspberry Pi to index the data collected by the weather station. I finalized the study interviewing a number of citizen weather observers. The work done in this project laid the foundation for my thesis work on the smart sea-level sensor project.
